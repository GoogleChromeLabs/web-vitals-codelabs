# Measure performance with web-vitals.js, Google Analytics and BigQuery code samples

This repository contains two example pages to accompany the [Measure performance with web-vitals.js, Google Analytics and BigQuery](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-vitals-google-analytics-biqquery) codelab.

* [`basic.html`](/basic.html) demonstrates adding the `web-vitals` library as a module and printing its output to the console.
* [`diagnostics.html`](/diagnostics.html) demonstrates using `web-vitals` and `PerformanceObserver` APIs to gather rich debugging information about Core Web Vitals metrics.
