# Core Web Vitals codelabs

## Understanding Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

[This directory](understanding-inp/) contains code and answers for the [Understanding INP codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/understanding-inp).

## Measure performance with web-vitals.js, Google Analytics and BigQuery code samples

[This directory](web-vitals-google-analytics-bigquery/) contains two example pages to accompany the [Measure performance with web-vitals.js, Google Analytics and BigQuery](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-vitals-google-analytics-biqquery) codelab.

* [`basic.html`](web-vitals-google-analytics-bigquery/basic.html) demonstrates adding the `web-vitals` library as a module and printing its output to the console.
* [`diagnostics.html`](web-vitals-google-analytics-bigquery/diagnostics.html) demonstrates using `web-vitals` and `PerformanceObserver` APIs to gather rich debugging information about Core Web Vitals metrics.
